Fork of Charlatan: Fixtures Made Easy [unmaintained]
============================================

About Fork
----------

This is a fork of uber/charlatan project.
Its purpose is to keep using the Charlatan project for legacy tests with a newer
python versions. As this is a legacy project I will be looking to replace the
project rather than maintaining it.

I will not seek to actively maintain this project beyond what is required
for my particular use case.

**⚠️ This repository is not actively maintained anymore.**

`Charlatan` is a library that you can use in your tests to create database
fixtures. Its aim is to provide a pragmatic interface that focuses on making it
simple to define and install fixtures for your tests. It is also agnostic in so
far as even though it's designed to work out of the box with SQLAlchemy models,
it can work with pretty much anything else.
